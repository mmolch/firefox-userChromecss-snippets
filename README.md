Snippets for Firefox's userChrome.css

## Files
  * restore-tabs-in-firefox89.css \
    Brings back tabs in Firefox 89+ (Proton). It's usually referred to as  "Tabbed Browsing" and not as "Buttoned Browsing" after all... Only tested in Xfce with my custom theme.

  * tabbar-customization.css
    * Remove the close button from tabs, good if you only use the middle mouse button to close tabs.
    * Remove the space at the beginning of the tabbar in window mode

  * userChrome.css \
    The userChrome.css file that I use on all of my systems with Firefox 89+. Reduces the compact layout in Firefox 89+ back to the previous versions, doesn't enlarge the url bar when active, restores tabs and tweaks some minor stuff.
